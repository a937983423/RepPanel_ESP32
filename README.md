# RepPanel

A simple user interface for Duet/RepRap based 3D printers. Optimized for 3.5" touch
panels controlled via SPI & I²C using an ESP32.

Supports wireless connection or wired via UART/PanelDue port.

An open source alternative to the PanelDue.
  - Cheap (~18€ display + 7€ ESP32)
  - Beautifully dark
  - Compact and easy to use
  - Support for most operations required to set up a 3D print
  - Wireless connection - portable with power bar
  - PanelDue-port/UART connection

## [I am interested in buying a RepPanel all-in-one module (no DIY)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc41e0SKuG6xnuFPz0I5em8UYw0sTvzpZe8-aQhP_QksgwWyg/viewform)
The all-in-one module is currently not available but you can give me an idea on how much interest there is. The module will be ready to use and thinner than a DIY solution. It includes a custom board, display and more capable ESP32 (more storage for directory listings etc.). I would try to get the price somewhere ~50-60€ + shipping from Germany. Click the link above and enter your email to get notified when a module becomes available. Thanks!

## What this project is not
A full replacement for the DuetWebControl interface.

## Supported Hardware/Software
The RepPanel project is based on the [LVGL port for the ESP32](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32/tree/c1f43bfb090df293059ab52baabbdbdd8df00712).
In theory this means all displays and touch controllers supported by the **lv_port_esp32** project are also supported
by RepPanel.

**Tested Hardware**
  - ESP32 DevKit
  - [ER-TFTM035-6 display with capacitive touch screen, 4-Wire SPI, No font chip required](https://www.buydisplay.com/lcd-3-5-inch-320x480-tft-display-module-optl-touch-screen-w-breakout-board)

**Beware: There are numerous version of the ER-TFT035-6. You must choose the one with the SPI interface. Do not get the arduino shield version (no SPI config). The version with the screen breakout board is sufficient.**  
Other display modules with a resolution of 480x320 should also work as long as they are supported by `lv_port_esp32`  
As of now RepPanel is optimized for 3.5" displays with a resolution of 480x320 pixels. The display is connected via SPI.

**Tested Firmware**
  - Duet2 WiFi running RepRap Firmware v3.0 and corresponding Duet2WebControl
  - Duet2 WiFi running RepRap Firmware v3.1 and corresponding Duet2WebControl

## Installation
Use ready made images or compile yourself.

### Compile yourself

#### Set up ESP-IDF

[Follow instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.0/get-started/index.html#step-1-install-prerequisites) on offical Espressif site.  
ESP-IDF v4.0 is officially supported.

#### Clone Project

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/seeul8er/RepPanel_ESP32
```
LVGL v7 is not supported. Last tested release of `lv_port_esp32` is commit `c1f43bfb090df293059ab52baabbdbdd8df00712`.
The project is linked against a fork to keep the legacy support and be able to fix bugs.

#### Configure Project

From its root run:
```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```
**See [Custom LVGL port for the ESP32](https://github.com/seeul8er/lv_port_esp32/tree/c1f43bfb090df293059ab52baabbdbdd8df00712) for further and more detailed instructions.**

#### Compile & Flash
```bash
idf.py build
idf.py -p (YOUR PORT) flash
```
**See [LVGL port for the ESP32](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32/tree/c1f43bfb090df293059ab52baabbdbdd8df00712) for further and more detailed instructions.**

### Use ready made images
Ready made images are only available for selected hardware combinations! Please compile the project by yourself in
case you use different hardware or want a different pin connection layout

Check out [releases](https://github.com/seeul8er/RepPanel_ESP32/releases) for compiled binaries.

### Wiring ER-TFTM035-6 to the ESP32 DevKit

**Beware:** The available development boards have different pin configurations. Some have GND & 3.3V at the bottom. Others at the top.

Pin configuration of ready made images:

## For Developers
[Check out the simulator project.](https://github.com/seeul8er/RepPanel_sim) Simulates the RepPanel GUI on Desktop computers for more efficient testing and implementation.

**Custom changes to lv_conf.h**  
Copy file content of `main/lv_conf_back.h` over to `externals/lv_port_esp32/components/lvgl/lv_conf.h`.  
Or simply add:
- Set `LV_USE_USER_DATA 1`
- Add `#define LV_USE_THEME_REP_PANEL_DARK 1`
- Set `LV_INDEV_DEF_DRAG_THROW 85` to decrease DMA usage and increase stability
- `CONFIG_LVGL_FONT_ROBOTO16` & `CONFIG_LVGL_FONT_ROBOTO22` must be activated
- Add
```C
#define LV_FONT_CUSTOM_DECLARE  LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_bold_16) \
                                       LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_bold_18) \
                                       LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_bold_24) \
                                       LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_regular_26) \
                                       LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_light_26) \
                                       LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_thin_numeric_160) \
                                       LV_FONT_DECLARE(reppanel_font_roboto_regular_percent_40)
```

## Known Limitations
- Multiple tools supported but not tested
- Auto swap from UART to WiFi connection might take up to 10s
- Entries per directory listing limited to 16 for jobs and macros
- Directory path limited to 128 characters
- Filament listing (all filament names separated by one character) limited to 1014
- Can not list all files within a directory in case DuetWebControl API requires multiple requests per listing
  - Workaround: Delete files to reduce file count to make all files fit within one response
  
## Known Bugs
- Messages printed by G-Code commands can not be "clicked away"
- Irregular freezes of the screen with RRF 3.1
